# 🎉 Netlify Deployment Success!

## ✅ Deployment Status: **SUCCESSFUL**

### 🚀 Live Site URLs:
- **Production**: https://urso.no
- **Deploy Preview**: https://683fd40d250bce06a02da611--fervent-franklin-3037c2.netlify.app

### 📊 Deployment Details:
- ✅ **Build**: Successful (.NET 10 preview)
- ✅ **Deploy**: Successful to Netlify
- ✅ **DNS**: Custom domain configured (urso.no)
- ⚠️ **GitHub Comments**: Disabled (permission issues)

### 🔧 Fixed Issues:
The error messages you saw were **not deployment failures** - they were GitHub API permission issues for:
- Commit comments (`enable-commit-comment: false`)
- GitHub deployments (`enable-github-deployment: false`)
- PR comments (`enable-pull-request-comment: false`)

The actual Netlify deployment was **100% successful**!

### 🎯 What Works Now:
1. **Automatic deployment** on every push to `main` branch
2. **Custom domain** (urso.no) pointing to your Blazor site
3. **.NET 10 preview** building successfully in GitHub Actions
4. **Clean deployment** without GitHub API errors

### 🚀 Next Steps:
Your Urso website is now **live and running** on .NET 10!
